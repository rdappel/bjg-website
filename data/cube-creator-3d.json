	"description": "Craft your own realm in stunning randomly generated worlds in Cube Creator 3D. You can also gather resources, combine elements, explore & combat strange creatures to survive in this expansive, cubic domain. Creative Mode allows you to explore worlds in true Stereoscopic 3D. The dual-screen presentation keeps your resource inventory free from cluttering the gameplay screen. Easy-to-use touchscreen controls make the open-world gameplay better than ever. Break-through dynamic lighting & effects positions Cube Creator 3D a cube above the rest. In Survival Mode, players can explore, craft, mine, & battle in forest, desert, mountain, & tundra-themed worlds. To start, you must use only your bare hands to gather resources to then craft tools & weapons, & to build protective shelters. Building better tools & weapons allows you to explore caves, mine their precious ores, & combat the many malicious monsters. Craft, explore and conquer these voxel worlds to make them entirely your own realm."
