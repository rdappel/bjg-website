						<h2>Cube Creator X</h2>
						<p>Big John Games, in a partnership with ARC Systems Works, brings the latest adaptation of
							the Cube Creator series to the Nintendo Switch with Cube Creator X. The Nintendo Switch
							allows Cube Creator X to stretch its legs and accommodate much larger worlds which feel
							vast and alive (more than three times the total cubes in Cube Creator DX). ARC Systems’
							incredible history of brilliant art direction is evident in a massive cosmetic upgrade
							in character and level design. Multiplayer is supported for Competitive and Cooperative
							styles of play up to four players. In Cube Creator X, players can choose Creative Mode
							to create their masterpiece worlds. Robust editing tools can be utilized to help unleash
							player’s creativity more efficiently. In Adventure Mode, players will embark on various
							quests and fight epic battles. Players create shelters, and even fortresses and cities.
							Many new items have been added, including weapons, architecture, and agriculture cubes.
							Half-cubes have also been added, along with the ability for the main character to
							experience hot &amp; cold, as well as the ability to grow in size after consuming food
							items. The Stages Mode allows players to create stage levels with a jumping-off point
							and a goal to be accomplished. Players can add movement blocks, monsters, treasure
							chests, along with many more new, unique cubes. The players’ stages can be uploaded to
							the Cube Creator X community (the Plaza) to be shared with anyone looking for their next
							challenging stage to conquer.</p>
